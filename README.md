## 🧭 My Developer Story

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate who doesn’t just learn tech — I **use it to build**.  
From AI-powered career tools to scalable backend systems, I enjoy turning ideas into working products.

I’m especially interested in:
- **Full-Stack Development**
- **AI-powered applications**
- **Clean backend systems**
- **Products people actually use**
